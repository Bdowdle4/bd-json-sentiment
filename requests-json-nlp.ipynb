    "#### *All interpretations were found by googling the song*\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Crazy (-0.218)** is about the idea that people should be themselves, even if it means being considered crazy. I would say that a negative score is accurate! Because even though the song meaning is positive the lyrics definitely make it sound like a bad situation.\n",
    "+ **99 Problems (-0.194)** is about a traffic stop encounter with the police and the contested issues of search and seizure law. I would say that a slightly negative score is appropriate.\n",
    "+ **Crazy in Love (0.024)** is about how, when you are falling in love, you do things that are out of character and you do not really care because you are just open. I am surprised that it isn't more positive, but I think a positive score is accurate.\n",
    "+ **Hey Ya! (0.072)** is about the state of relationships in the 2000s, and how people can end up unhappy in relationships they stay in out of fear of being alone or the world’s expectations of what a relationship should be. I can safely say that I have never thought of this being a sad song. It is upbeat and has some positive connotations when listening. I would say this score falls to the misinterpretted category since it has a positive score. (But the tool wasn't the only one who was fooled!)"
